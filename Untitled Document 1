OVERVIEW

This chapter deals with linking pair of elements from two sets and then introduce relations between
the two elements in the pair. Practically in every day of our lives, we pair the members of two sets of
numbers. For example, each hour of the day is paired with the local temperature reading by T.V.
Station&#39;s weatherman, a teacher often pairs each set of score with the number of students receiving
that score to see more clearly how well the class has understood the lesson. Finally, we shall learn
about special relations called functions.
        

DEFINITION

Given two non-empty sets A and B, the set of all ordered pairs (x, y), where x ∈ A and y ∈ B is called
Cartesian product of A and B;
symbolically, we write A × B = {(x, y) | x ∈ A and y ∈ B} If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}, then A × B = {(1,
4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)} and B × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}
(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal
and the second elements are also equal, i.e. (x, y) = (u, v) if and only if x = u, y = v.
(ii) If n(A) = p and n (B) = q, then n (A × B) = p × q.
(iii) A × A × A = {(a, b, c) : a, b, c ∈ A}. Here (a, b, c) is called an ordered triplet.

RELATION

A Relation R from a non-empty set A to a non empty set B is a subset of the Cartesian product set A
× B. The subset is derived by describing a relationship between the first element and the second
element of the ordered pairs in A × B. The set of all first elements in a relation R, is called the domain
of the relation R, and the set of all second elements called images, is called the range of R. For
example, the set R = {(1, 2), (– 2, 3), ( 1 2 , 3)} is a relation; the domain of R = {1, – 2, 1 2 } and the
range of R = {2, 3}.
(i) A relation may be represented either by the Roster form or by the set builder form, or
by an arrow diagram which is a visual representation of a relation.
(ii) If n (A) = p, n (B) = q; then the n (A × B) = pq and the total number of possible relations
from the set A to set B = 2pq .


TYPE OF RELATIONS


1. Void Relation (Empty Relation): 
A relation R in a set A is called Void relation or Empty relation, if no element of set A is related to
any element of A.

Hence R = ɸ which is a subset of A x A. 
For example: 
Let A = {1, 2, 5, 8}, then 
R = {(x, y), x, y  A, x � y = 7} is an example of void relation in A, since no ordered pair (x, y) 
 A x A satisfies x � y = 8.

2. Identity Relation: 
For a given set A, I = {(a, a), a  A} is called the Identity relation in A. In identity relation every
element of A is related to itself only.

For example: 
If A = {2, 3 ,4} then I = {(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)} is the identity relation in A.

3. Symmetric Relation: 
A relation R in a set A is said to be Symmetric if and only if aRb    L    bRa for all a, b  A.
For example: 
The relation &quot;is equal to&quot; is a symmetric relation for if a = b then b = a. 
4. Transitive Relation: 
A relation in a set A is called Transitive if and only if, (a, b)  R and (b, c)  R then (a, c)  R for all
a, b, c  A.

For example: 
The relation &quot;is greater than&quot; is a transitive relation, if a &gt; b and b &gt; c, then a &gt; c. 

5. Reflexive Relation: 
A relation R in a set A is said to be Reflexive if and only if aRa, for all a  A. It means, every element
of A is related to itself.

For example: 
Let A = {3, 4, 5} and R = {(a, a) : a  A} 
Hence, R = {(3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)} which is a reflexive relation. 
6. Equivalence Relation: 
A relation R in a set A is called an Equivalence relation if and only if

1. it is Reflexive that is, (a, a)  R for all a  A.
2. it is Symmetric that is, (a, b)  R   L   (b, a)  R for all a, b  A.
